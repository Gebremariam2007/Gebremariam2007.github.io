        <h2>Hello, I'm Abel Gebremarima</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my personal website!  In this website you will leand about my intresa and hobbies and future goals of mine.
        <p>
            I am originally from Eritrea, a small yet beautiful country located in 
            the Horn of Africa. In 2017, I made the life-changing decision to move 
            to the United States in pursuit of new opportunities and a brighter future.
             This transition allowed me to embrace a new culture, meet people from diverse 
             backgrounds, and expand my horizons both personally and professionally. Though 
             the journey has had its challenges, it has also been incredibly rewarding. 
             My experiences in both Eritrea and the U.S. have shaped my values, giving me 
             a unique perspective on the world and fueling 
            my passion for growth, learning, and contributing to my community.
