                    <img src="link and image">
                    <p> I started playing soccer in 8th grade, and it quickly became a 
                        passion that shaped my high school experience. Determined to improve, 
                        I dedicated countless hours to practice, honing my skills and learning 
                        the game inside and out. My hard work paid off when I made the varsity 
                        squad, a dream come true. By my junior year, I was honored to be named 
                        captain of the team, a role that not only allowed me to lead my teammates 
                        but also deepened my love for the sport. This journey taught me the importance of teamwork, 
                        perseverance, and the thrill of achieving goals, both on and off the field. .</p>

                    <h3>Project 2</h3>
                    <p> Creating an Eritrean krar from scratch was an incredibly rewarding experience for
                         me. As I delved into the process, I discovered the intricate craftsmanship and cultural 
                         significance behind this traditional instrument. From selecting the wood to shaping the 
                         body and strings, every step allowed me to connect deeply with Eritrean heritage. The moment
                          I strummed the first notes, I felt a sense of accomplishment and pride, knowing that I had 
                          not only built an instrument but also a bridge to a rich musical 
                        tradition. It was truly a journey of creativity and self-discovery..</p>
